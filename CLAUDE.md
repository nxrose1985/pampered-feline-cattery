# Pampered Feline Maine Coons — Website Project Handoff

## What This Is

This is the full context file for building the Pampered Feline Maine Coons website from scratch. Read this entire file before doing anything. The goal is a luxury, boutique-feel Maine Coon cattery website that looks premium, loads fast, and converts qualified kitten buyers.

---

## Project Owner

- **Cattery name:** Pampered Feline Maine Coons
- **Owner:** Sara Corry
- **Location:** Northern Virginia
- **Domain:** pamperedfelinemainecoons.com — registered at GoDaddy
- **Email:** TBD — professional email recommended (Google Workspace, $6/month)
- **Instagram:** TBD

---

## Related Businesses (Same Owner — Do Not Confuse)

| Business | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pampered Ferret store | Shopify | thepamperedferret.com |
| Pampered Feline cat treats / food | Shopify | Separate Shopify store, separate domain |
| Pampered Feline Maine Coons cattery | To build — Astro + Netlify | pamperedfelinemainecoons.com |

The cattery site is completely separate from the cat treat Shopify store. They share brand language but serve different audiences and live on different platforms.

---

## Core Goal

Build a polished, luxury-positioned website for a small Maine Coon cattery. The site targets prospective kitten buyers first. Secondary audiences include show-home prospects and future breeding program contacts.

The site must:
- Feel exclusive, curated, and calm — not mass-market
- Convert qualified leads through a contact/application form
- Rank for Maine Coon buyer-intent keywords (Northern Virginia + national luxury market)
- Showcase cats and kittens with strong photography
- Signal health-focused, ethical breeding

The guiding brand concept: **small program, high standards.**

## Stack Decision — CONFIRMED

**Astro + Tailwind + Sanity CMS + Netlify**

### Why This Stack

**Astro** is the framework. It builds pages into fast static HTML. Almost no JavaScript ships to the browser. Perfect for a content site like this. Better Lighthouse scores than Next.js for mostly-static content.

**Tailwind** handles all styling. Utility classes written directly in components. No separate CSS files to manage.

**Sanity CMS** is Sara's dashboard. She logs in, adds a kitten listing, updates availability, hits publish. No code required. Free tier covers this site (up to 2 users, 10GB storage).

**Netlify** hosts the site. Free tier. Connects to GitHub. Every push triggers an automatic rebuild and deploy. Built-in CDN, contact form handling, and SSL included.

### Domain Connection Plan

1. Build and deploy site on Netlify first
2. Netlify assigns a temporary URL (e.g. pampered-feline.netlify.app)
3. Log into GoDaddy DNS settings for pamperedfelinemainecoons.com
4. Update nameservers or A record to point at Netlify (Netlify provides exact values)
5. SSL certificate activates automatically
6. DNS propagates within an hour

### What Was Ruled Out and Why

| Tool | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| GoDaddy hosting | No | Shared hosting, slow, designed for WordPress |
| Squarespace / Wix | No | Limits design control and SEO flexibility |
| Next.js | Fallback only | Better for web apps; overkill for a static cattery site |
| Vercel | Not needed here | Pairs with Next.js; Netlify pairs better with Astro |
| Hugo | No | Harder templating, less CMS-friendly |
| S3 + CloudFront | No | Overkill; Netlify's CDN handles this |
| Bunny CDN | No | Overkill at this traffic level |
| Supabase | Not for this site | Correct tool for the inventory app and TPF tools suite |
| React standalone | No | Astro handles rendering here |

### Note on the Broader Tech Ecosystem

These tools belong to other projects, not this site:

**React + Next.js** — for the inventory app and TPF tools suite. Those apps need real interactivity: forms, state, user sessions, dynamic data.

**Vercel** — hosts Next.js apps. Use it for the inventory app and tools suite.

**Supabase** — database and backend for the inventory app. Handles user login, data storage, and querying. Free tier covers small internal tools.

Full picture across all projects:

| Project | Framework | CMS / Database | Hosting | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cattery website | Astro | Sanity | Netlify | pamperedfelinemainecoons.com |
| Cat treat store | Shopify | Shopify | Shopify | TBD |
| Ferret store | Shopify | Shopify | Shopify | thepamperedferret.com |
| Inventory app / TPF tools | Next.js + React | Supabase | Vercel | TBD |

## Git and GitHub — How It Works

Git is version control. It tracks every change to code and lets you roll back to any previous state.

Your code lives in two places:
- **Local:** Your computer (C:\Projects\pampered-feline)
- **Remote:** GitHub (cloud copy, also triggers Netlify deploys)

### The Four Commands You Need Daily

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "describe what changed"
git push
git pull
```

Push triggers Netlify to rebuild and redeploy automatically. The live site updates in about 60 seconds.

### One-Time Setup

```powershell
winget install Git.Git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Create a free account at github.com. Claude Code walks through connecting the repo in the first session.

## Design Direction

### Visual Feel
- Luxury, minimal, high-whitespace
- Boutique hotel or high-end lifestyle brand — not pet store
- Calm, elegant, exclusive but not cold
- Reference site for feel (not copying): SlowBlink Maine Coons

### Colors
- Background: soft off-white or warm ivory
- Text: deep charcoal or near-black
- Accent: muted gold, rich forest green, or one jewel tone (plum or deep teal)
- No bright colors, no gradients, no clipart

### Typography
- Headings: Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, or DM Serif Display
- Body: Lato, Montserrat, or DM Sans
- Style: elegant serif headlines, clean sans-serif body, letter-spaced small caps for labels

### Photography
- Full-width hero images
- Close-up cat portraits: faces, tufted ears, paws, profiles
- Clean uncluttered backgrounds
- Photography quality is the single highest-risk factor for the luxury feel
- Nick has some photos — more TBD from Sara

### Layout
- Large margins, lots of whitespace
- Sticky navigation
- Centered logo/header
- Long-scroll editorial homepage
- Three-column pillar section
- Card-based kitten and cat listings
- All layouts reviewed on mobile first — most visitors arrive from Instagram on a phone

### Hero
Pampered Feline Maine Coons
European-type Maine Coons with presence, structure, and steady temperaments.

A Small Program With High Standards
Pampered Feline is a home-based Maine Coon cattery in Northern Virginia. We breed selectively, with limited litters, careful pairings, and hands-on care from birth. Every kitten leaves with a health guarantee, a written contract, and a family that knows their name.

### Health Preview Block
Health, Ethics, and Care
We DNA-test our breeding cats for HCM, SMA, and PKDef. Hearts are monitored as cats mature. We follow a transparent, written ethical standard and work with a feline-friendly veterinarian.

## Draft Copy — Our Cats Intro

Each breeding cat is selected for temperament, health, and balanced European type. We prefer lines known for bone, structure, strong muzzles, and clean profiles. Color and coat are secondary to what the cat is.
